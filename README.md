# Randy Lenasty Personal Site

This repository contains a minimal static website served via GitHub Pages. It offers two clean pages:

- **Tech Blog** (`index.html`): highlights recent posts and provides a hero section with a brief introduction.
- **Curriculum Vitae** (`cv.html`): structured resume-style layout outlining experience, education, and skills.

To update the site, edit the HTML files in the repository. Shared styles live in `assets/css/style.css`.

## Local preview

You can open the HTML files directly in a browser, or serve the repository with any static file server such as Python's built-in module:

```bash
python -m http.server
```

Then visit <http://localhost:8000> in your browser.
